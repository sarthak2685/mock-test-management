              We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. None of your information, including your performance on tests, will be shared with any third party. Some of your performance information may be shown anonymously to other registered users of the site if you are in the topper's list (or similar) of a defined category.

              A feature of the site allows a user to access another user's (or friend's) score by entering both the other user's (or friend's) username and registered email. Hence, it is your responsibility to ensure that you do not reveal both your username and registered email on the site with anyone else apart from those with whom you are willing to share your performance data. MockPeriod.com does not take any responsibility for the loss of confidentiality of your username and registered email through actions that are out of MockPeriod.com control.
